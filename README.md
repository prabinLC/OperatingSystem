 This program is a simple file manager 
 that allows users to view, edit, 
 run, change directories, sort files, 
 and remove files in the current directory. 
 It supports basic commands and displays 
 files in pages, allowing navigation through them.

 Note: just clone the repo and use UNIX based OS.
 As system calls are based on the UNIX basesd OS i.e MAC or Linux.
 Have Fun!!!!!!!
